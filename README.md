I'm new in coding and need some help
i was watching a video on youtube (link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WIDDP28nH8) i copy what this guy does so I can remember coding again, but i got stuck at the point (timeline 2:07:06) when he runs the program and he choose the name from the datagridview and It goes to the left (Name,Phone and address) but when i run the program nothing happens
I wanna learn what was my mistake because I can't find any
Can someone explain to me what I did wrong there?
thx for your time!!!
